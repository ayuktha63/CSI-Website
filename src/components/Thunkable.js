                        <b>Engineering 101</b> is a workshop series designed to empower students by enhancing their skills across various domains
                        through hands-on learning. Initiated by CSI SB MBCET in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science &
                        Engineering, the series aims to shape well-rounded engineers equipped for both academic and professional success.
                        <br></br>
                        As part of the series, a <b>Thunkable Workshop</b> was conducted on 22nd March 2025 via Discord from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM.
                        The session was led by Mr. Kiran Biju, a 6th-semester CSE student and Treasurer of CSI SB MBCET. Mr. Kiran Biju provided hands-on guidance, making the
                        session highly interactive and engaging.
                        <br></br>
                        Participants were introduced to Thunkable, a no-code platform for mobile app development. The session was interactive and
                        beginner-friendly, offering practical insights into app creation without coding experience.
                        <br></br>
                        The workshop was well-received, aligning with Engineering 101â€™s vision of providing students with essential
                        technical skills beyond the classroom.
